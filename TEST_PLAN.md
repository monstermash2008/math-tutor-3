# Automated Testing Plan: Interactive Math Tutor

This document outlines the automated testing strategy for the Interactive Math Solver Engine project. The plan is aligned with the four phases of the implementation plan, enabling a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach where tests are written before the corresponding features.

## Testing Stack:

**Test Runner/Framework**: Vitest  
**Component/DOM Testing**: React Testing Library (RTL)  
**API Mocking**: Mock Service Worker (MSW)  
**Code Coverage**: Vitest with V8 Provider  

## 📊 **Code Coverage Implementation Status** *(Updated: December 2024)*

### **Current Coverage Metrics:**
✅ **97/97 tests passing** (100% test success rate)  
✅ **52.46% statements/lines** (exceeds 45% threshold)  
✅ **76.92% functions** (exceeds 60% threshold)  
✅ **82.98% branches** (exceeds 70% threshold)  

### **Coverage Configuration:**
- **Provider**: V8 (fastest, most accurate)
- **Reporters**: Text (terminal), JSON (CI/CD), HTML (interactive)
- **Reports Directory**: `./coverage/`
- **Focused Scope**: Core business logic files only
- **Smart Exclusions**: UI components, routes, generated files, test files

### **Available Commands:**
```bash
pnpm test:coverage              # Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage:watch        # Watch mode with live updates
pnpm test:coverage:ui          # Interactive UI mode
pnpm coverage:open             # Open HTML report in browser
```

### **Well-Tested Areas (High Coverage):**
- **`math-engine.ts`** - 95.37% coverage ⭐ (excellent)
- **`validation-engine.ts`** - 82.64% coverage ✅ (good)
- **`FeedbackDisplay.tsx`** - 94.62% coverage ⭐ (excellent)
- **`UserInput.tsx`** - 100% coverage ⭐ (perfect)
- **`ProblemView.tsx`** - 100% coverage ⭐ (perfect)

### **Areas Needing Attention (Low/No Coverage):**
- **`src/lib/utils.ts`** - 0% coverage 🔴 (high priority)
- **Route components** - 0% coverage 🟡 (medium priority)
- **`ProblemCard.tsx`** - 0% coverage 🟡 (medium priority)
- **`ProblemCreator.tsx`** - 0% coverage 🟡 (medium priority)
- **Convex backend functions** - 0% coverage 🟡 (separate test setup needed)

### **Next Steps for Coverage Improvement:**

**🚀 High Priority** (Low effort, high impact):
1. **Add tests for `src/lib/utils.ts`** - Currently 0% coverage, likely contains utility functions
2. **Test error paths in `validation-engine.ts`** - Lines 82-83, 158-164, 190-191, 224-234
3. **Complete `llm-feedback-service.ts` coverage** - Currently 83.76%, missing error handling paths

**🎯 Medium Priority**:
1. **Add component tests for `ProblemCard.tsx` and `ProblemCreator.tsx`**
2. **Integration tests for route components** (`index.tsx`, `library.tsx`, `create.tsx`)
3. **Test uncovered paths in `MathTutorApp.tsx`** - Lines 203-249, 294-296, 327-334, 341-345

**🔄 Optional/Future**:
1. **Convex function testing** - Requires separate test environment setup
2. **E2E testing** - For complete user workflows
3. **Performance testing** - For math engine with complex expressions

### **Coverage Quality Assessment:**
- **Core Math Engine**: Exceptional coverage (95%+) provides high confidence in mathematical correctness
- **Validation Logic**: Good coverage (82%+) with focus on business logic paths
- **UI Components**: Mixed coverage - critical components well-tested, utility components need attention
- **Integration Points**: Well-tested through comprehensive integration test suite

## Phase 1: Unit Testing the Core Mathematical Engine ✅ **COMPLETED**
Testing Goal: To achieve high confidence in the mathematical logic by rigorously testing the pure functions in the validation.js module. These tests will be fast, isolated, and will form the foundation of the application's reliability.

**Tools**: Vitest  
**Status**: ✅ All test suites implemented and passing  
**Coverage**: 95.37% for `math-engine.ts`, 82.64% for `validation-engine.ts`

**Key Test Suites**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

- `getCanonical.test.js` → `math-engine.core.test.ts`
- `isFullySimplified.test.js` → `math-engine.capabilities.test.ts`
- `validateStep.test.js` → `validation-engine.test.ts`

**Detailed Test Cases & Scenarios**: ✅ **COMPLETED WITH ENHANCEMENTS**

**getCanonical Suite**: ✅ All scenarios implemented and passing

**Expressions**:
- ✅ `it('should handle simple expressions')`: input '2x + 10', expect node equivalent to 2x + 10.
- ✅ `it('should handle reordered terms')`: input '10 + 2x', expect node equivalent to 2x + 10.
- ✅ `it('should handle expressions with distribution')`: input '4(x - 3)', expect node equivalent to 4x - 12.

**Equations**:

**UserInput Suite**: ✅ All scenarios implemented and passing
- ✅ `it('should call the onCheckStep prop with the input value on button click')`: Use fireEvent to simulate a click and assert the mock callback (vi.fn()) was called once with the correct payload.
- ✅ `it('should call onCheckStep on Enter key press')`: Use fireEvent.keyDown to simulate the "Enter" key and assert the callback was called.
- ✅ `it('should disable the input and button when isSolved prop is true')`: Render the component with isSolved={true} and assert that both the <input> and <button> elements have the disabled attribute.

**FeedbackDisplay Suite**: ✅ All scenarios implemented and passing
- ✅ `it('should display a loading state')`: Render the component with props like status='loading' and assert that a spinner or loading text is present.
- ✅ `it('should display a success message')`: Render with status='success' and message='Correct!' and assert the message is displayed with the correct CSS classes (e.g., bg-green-50).
- ✅ `it('should display an error message')`: Render with status='error' and assert the message is displayed with error-related styles.

**📈 Enhancements Beyond Original Plan**:
- ✅ **Accessibility Testing**: Added screen reader support with proper SVG titles

**🚀 Additional Integration Tests Implemented**:
- ✅ **Async Validation Flow**: Tests loading states and asynchronous step validation
- ✅ **State Synchronization**: Verifies UI state consistency during user interactions
- ✅ **Error Recovery**: Tests graceful handling of parsing errors and malformed input

---

## Phase 4: End-to-End and Service Mocking for LLM Integration ✅ **COMPLETED**
Testing Goal: To verify the final piece of the application: the asynchronous communication with the OpenRouter API. This ensures prompts are correctly formatted and API responses (both success and failure) are handled gracefully in the UI.

**Tools**: Vitest, RTL, Mock Service Worker (MSW)  
**Status**: ✅ Core functionality implemented and tested  
**Coverage**: 83.76% for `llm-feedback-service.ts`

**Key Test Suites**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

- `LLMFeedbackService.test.js` → `llm-feedback-service.test.ts`
- `App.integration.llm.test.jsx` → Integrated into `MathTutorApp.integration.test.tsx`

**Detailed Test Cases & Scenarios**: ✅ **COMPLETED**

**LLMFeedbackService Suite (Unit Tests)**: ✅ All scenarios implemented and passing
- ✅ `it('should construct the correct prompt for an EQUIVALENCE_FAILURE')`: Call constructPrompt with the context for a specific error and assert the output string contains all the key pieces of information (problem statement, user history, input, error code).
- ✅ `it('should construct the correct prompt for a CORRECT_BUT_NOT_SIMPLIFIED state')`: Do the same for the simplification scenario.

**App Integration Suite (with MSW)**: ✅ Implemented within integration tests

**Setup**: ✅ MSW integration completed for API mocking

**Successful Feedback Flow**: ✅ Implemented and passing
