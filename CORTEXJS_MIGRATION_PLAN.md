# CortexJS Migration - COMPLETED

This document outlines the completed migration from MathJS to the CortexJS ecosystem.

## ✅ Migration Status: COMPLETE

The migration from MathJS to CortexJS has been successfully completed. The application now uses:
- **CortexJS Compute Engine** for all mathematical computation
- **Direct CortexJS imports** in all components and validation logic
- **Native CortexJS APIs** for expression parsing, simplification, and equivalence checking

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. Math Engine Replacement
- ✅ Replaced MathJS with CortexJS Compute Engine
- ✅ Updated all mathematical operations to use CortexJS APIs
- ✅ Removed MathJS dependency from package.json
- ✅ Deleted legacy math_engine.ts file
- ✅ Removed math_engine_bridge.ts after migration completion

### 2. API Updates
- ✅ Updated validation_engine.ts to use CortexJS directly
- ✅ Updated all test files to use CortexJS functions
- ✅ Consolidated all math operations in cortex_math_engine.ts

### 3. Type System Updates
- ✅ Removed MathJS type dependencies
- ✅ Updated SimplificationPattern to use BoxedExpression
- ✅ Cleaned up import statements across the codebase

## Current Architecture

The application now uses a clean, single-engine architecture:

```
convex/
├── cortex_math_engine.ts     # Primary math engine (CortexJS)
├── validation_engine.ts      # Uses CortexJS directly
└── validation.ts             # Convex validation endpoints
```

## Available Functions

All mathematical operations are now handled through `cortex_math_engine.ts`:

```typescript
// Expression parsing
parseLatexExpression(latex: string): BoxedExpression
parseTextExpression(text: string): BoxedExpression

// Equivalence checking
checkEquivalence(expr1: string, expr2: string): boolean
areEquivalent(expr1: string, expr2: string): boolean
areCanonicallyEquivalent(expr1: string, expr2: string): boolean

// Simplification
simplifyExpression(expr: BoxedExpression): BoxedExpression
isFullySimplifiedCortex(input: string): boolean

// Analysis
analyzeExpressionTreeCortex(input: string): TreeAnalysisResult
getSimplificationFeedback(patterns: SimplificationPattern[]): string[]

// Validation
validateMathInputSyntax(input: string): ValidationResult
```

## Migration Benefits Realized

1. **Improved Performance**: CortexJS provides better performance for complex expressions
2. **Better LaTeX Support**: Native LaTeX parsing and rendering
3. **Enhanced Simplification**: More sophisticated algebraic simplification
4. **Cleaner Architecture**: Single math engine reduces complexity
5. **Better Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with CortexJS

## Post-Migration Maintenance

- All new mathematical features should use CortexJS APIs exclusively
- Test coverage includes CortexJS-specific behavior verification
- Documentation reflects CortexJS-only implementation
- No fallback to legacy MathJS implementations

The migration is now complete and the application runs entirely on CortexJS.
